#  ðŸ““ Tutoring Scheduler (frontend)

My partner and I built this project as part of our software engineering bootcamp. This tutoring scheduler allows users to view tutors and to book/update/cancel tutoring sessions. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Please note, the frontend of this project is located in a different repository. Go to [Tutoring Scheduler (frontend)](https://github.com/sam-a-code/tutoring-scheduler-frontend) to access the backend of this project.

## ðŸ“– Installing our tutoring scheduler app
Create a parent directory where you will install both the frontend and the backend.

Clone the [frontend of this project](https://github.com/sam-a-code/tutoring-scheduler-frontend) in the parent directory. Then, navigate into the frontend directory and install:
#### `npm install`

Clone this repository in the parent directory as well. Then, navigate into this directory and complete the migrations for the database.
#### `rake db:migrate`

## ðŸ“š Using our tutoring scheduler app

In the backend directory, first run:
#### `bundle exec rake server`

This will run your backend on [http://localhost:9292](http://localhost:9292).

Then, you can run from the frontend directory:

#### `npm start`

This will run the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

When you make changes the page will reload automatically. You may also see lint errors in the console.
